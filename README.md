### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ChauneeG/ChauneeG** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my engineering degree. Looking to transfer to Penn state once through my A.S.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ in this class as well as attending a bootcamp for Front end web development.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything. I am always looking for mentors and the best ways to approach the everyday of an engineer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a Husband and father to 3 littles. Ages 6,4,2. My time outside of working full time and being a student is consumed by my family and I would not have it any other way.
